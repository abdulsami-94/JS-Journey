# **JS Journey**

A personal JavaScript learning archive containing my examples, experiments, mistakes, explanations, and daily progress as I learn JavaScript from scratch.
This repo is not a “project” — it is my **practice playground**, documenting every concept I learn with real code.

## 📘 **About This Repository**

This repo includes:

* JavaScript fundamentals
* DOM manipulation practice
* Input handling examples
* Common mistakes I made (and how I fixed them)
* Daily logs with explanations
* Small code snippets for each topic
* “Aha!” moments during learning

It shows my progress step-by-step as I build my foundation in JavaScript.

## 📝 **Learning Log**

I maintain a daily log where I write:

* What I learned
* What confused me
* What mistakes I made
* How I solved them

This helps me track progress and understand concepts more deeply.

---

## 🎯 **Purpose of This Repo**

* Build strong JS fundamentals
* Practise with real examples
* Document my coding journey
* Keep a record of mistakes and improvements
* Slowly prepare myself for building real projects

This repo is basically my **JavaScript diary** (but less cringe).

---

## 🚀 **Future Improvements**

* Organise code into topic-based folders
* Add a `LOG.md` file for all learning notes
* Add comments to each snippet
* Create a GitHub Pages demo for interactive examples
* Convert some exercises into mini-projects
