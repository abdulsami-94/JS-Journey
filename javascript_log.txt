Topic: Variable
  
Code: 
    let age = 25;
    let price = 10.99;
    let gpa = 8.5;

    console.log(`You are ${age} years old`);
    console.log(`The price is $${price}`);
    console.log(`Your gpa is : ${price}`);

Explanation: declared variables and printed them in console ${} is used to print the variable's value


  
Topic: Arithmetic Operator

Code: 
    let student = 30;

    students = students + 1;    Addition
    students = students - 1;    Substraction
    students = students * 2;    Multiplication
    students = students / 2;    Division
    students = students ** 1;   rais to
    students = students % 1;    Modules

* Augmented Assignment Operator

    Instead of students = students + 1; 
    we could use students ++ ; 

* Operator Precedence


Code:
    let result = 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 ** 2 ;
    console.log(result);

Explanation: So instead of 169 it will calculate its as 23 because it use the order of
            1. Parenthsis
            2. Exponents
            3. Mul & Div & Modules
            4. Add & Sub

Topic: User Input

Code: 
    let username ;
    username = window.prompt("What is your name?);
    console.log(username);

Explanation: it accepts user input using window pop up 


Code: 
    <h1 id="myH1">Welcome</h1>
    <label>Username: </label>
    <input id="myText"><br><br>
    <button id="mySubmit">Submit</button>

    let username;
    document.getElementById("mySubmit").onclick = function(){
      username = document.getElementById("myText").value;
      document.getElementById("myH1").textContent = `Hello ${username}`;
    }

Topic: Type Conversion

Code:
    let age = window.prompt("How old are you?");
    age = Number(age);
    age +=1;
    console.log(age, typeof age);

Explanation: Ask the user for the age using window prompt ,the age is stored in age variable then it is converted to Number using number function then its add's 1 values to it then print's it in console.



Code: 
    let x = "Shaikh";
    let y = "Shaikh";
    let z = "Shaikh";

    x = Number(x);
    y = String(y);
    z = Boolean(z);

    console.log(x, typeof x);
    console.log(y, typeof y);
    console.log(z, typeof z);

Explanation: there are 3 variables x, y and z all are string's then each of them are converted to a different types of data type then it is printed in console 
x is string it is converted to Number we get NaN(not a number) and it's data type which is Number
y is string it is converted to string we get Shaikh and it's data type which is string
z is string it is converted to Boolean we get true and it's data type which is Boolean, if we did put any value to it then it will show false



Topic: Constants

Code:
    const PI = 3.14159;
    let radius ;
    let circumference;

    radius = window.prompt("Enter the radius of the circle ?");
    radius = Number(radius);

    circumference = 2 * PI * radius;

    console.log(circumference);

Explanation: by declaring const it make the value Constant so it would be changed later in the code, radius and circumference is declared the we ask for the input using window prompt then convert it into number the apply the formula and print it.


Code:
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <label for="">Enter radius: </label>
    <input type="text" id="myText"><br><br>
    <button id="mySubmit">Submit</button>
    <h3 id="myH3"></h3>

    const PI = 3.14159;
    let radius ;
    let circumference;

    document.getElementById("mySubmit").onclick = function(){
    radius = document.getElementById("myText").value ;
    radius = Number(radius);
    circumference = 2 * PI * radius;
    document.getElementById("myH3").textContent = circumference + " cm" ;
    }

Explanation: we have declared const PI the radius and circumference then using document get element by id onclick function the same process is repeated but in this instead of displaying the answer in console it shows the answer in the document

Topic: Math

Code:
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    let c = 30;
    let d = 30.31;
    let e = 30.99;
    let f = 0;
    let g = 0;
    let x = 0;
    let y =0;
    let z =0;

    let max = Math.max(a, b, c);
    let min = Math.min(a, b, c);
    let k
    k = Math.ceil(d);
        let j
    j = Math.floor(e);
    let o
    o = Math.trunc(e);
    console.log (`The Max is ${max}`);
    console.log (`The Min is ${min}`);
    console.log (`The round up is ${k}`)
    console.log (`The round down is ${j}`)
    console.log(`the trunc is ${o}`);


Explanation: Math is a build in object that prvides a collection of properties and methods
like finding the max and min or round up of a number

Topic: if-else

Code:   
let age = 19 ;
    if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("Yor can see this site");
    } else {
       console.log("Close it boy!!");
    }

Explanation: using the if else we can execute the code on the basic of the condition if its true then run this if not then this


Code:
const myText = document.getElementById("myText");
const mySubmit = document.getElementById("mySubmit");
const answer = document.getElementById("answer");

let age ;
mySubmit.onclick = function() {
    age = myText.value;
    age = Number(age);

    if (age >= 18) {
        answer.textContent = (`You can see this site`);
    } else {
        answer.textContent = (`You cannnot see this site`);    }
    }

Explanation: there is a text box where the user will enter the age and submit by using the onclick function we check the age of the user and give the answer according to it



Topic: Checked Property

Code:
    <input type="checkbox" id="myCheckBox">
    <label for="myCheckBox">Suscribe to my NewsLetter</label><br><br>

    <input type="radio" id="visaBtn" name="button" >
    <label for="visaBtn">Visa</label><br>

    <input type="radio" id="masterCardBtn" name="button">
    <label for="masterCardBtn">Master Card</label><br>

    <input type="radio" id="payPalBtn" name="button">
    <label for="payPalBtn">PayPal</label><br><br>

    <button type="submit" id="mySubmit">Submit</button>
    <p id="subReport"></p>
    <p id="payResult"></p>


const myCheckBox = document.getElementById("myCheckBox");
const visaBtn = document.getElementById("visaBtn");
const masterCardBtn = document.getElementById("masterCardBtn");
const payPalBtn = document.getElementById("payPalBtn");
const mySubmit = document.getElementById("mySubmit");
const subReport = document.getElementById("subReport");
const payResult = document.getElementById("payResult");

mySubmit.onclick = function () {
    if(myCheckBox.checked) {
        subReport.textContent = (`You have Subcribed`);
    } else {
        subReport.textContent = (`You haven't Subscribe`)
    }

    if (visaBtn.checked) {
        payResult.textContent = (`You are paying using VISA`);
    } else if (masterCardBtn.checked) {
        payResult.textContent = (`You are paying using MASTERCARD`);
    } else if (payPalBtn.checked) {
        payResult.textContent = (`You are paying using PAYPAL`);
    } else {
        payResult.textContent = (`You haven't selected a payment method`);
    }
}

Explanation: there is a check box and a 3 radio button and a empty paragraph to display answer using if else and else if we can show different kind of answers

Topic: Ternart Operator

Code:   
let age = 90 ;
let message = age >= 18 ? "You're an ADULT" : "You're a MINOR" ;
console.log(message);

Explanation:an easy way instead of if-else ? is the condition is true : if the consditioon is false like in the above example if the age greater or equal to 18 the first code will run or else the second code will run



Topic: Switch Case

Code:
let day = 1 ;
switch(day) {
    case 1 :
        console.log("It's Monday");
        break;
    case 2 :
        console.log("It's Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3 :
        console.log("It's Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4 :
        console.log("It's Thursday");
        break;
    case 5 :
        console.log("It's Friday");
        break;
    case 6 :
        console.log("It's Saturday");
        break;
    case 7 :
        console.log("It's Sunday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log(`${day} is not a correct day`);
}

Explanation: Instead of using somany if else which is a bad practice we use switch case which is easy to read and manage



Topic: String Methods

Code: 
let userName = "Abdul Sami";

console.log(userName.charAt(0));
console.log(userName.indexOf("b"));
console.log(userName.length);
console.log(userName.trim());
console.log(userName.toUpperCase());
console.log(userName.toLowerCase());
console.log(userName.repeat(2));
console.log(userName.startsWith("A"));
console.log(userName.endsWith("i"));
console.log(userName.includes("u"));
console.log(userName.replaceAll("a", "s"));
console.log(userName.replaceAll("s", "a"));

Explanation: String methods are the kind of extra function that help us to use strings 


Topic: String Slicing 

Code: 
const fullName = "Abdul Sami" ;

let firstName = fullName.slice(0, 5);
let lastName = fullName.slice(6);

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);

const email = "abdulsamishaikh232@gmail.com";

let userName = email.slice(0, email.indexOf("@"));
let extension = email.slice(email.indexOf("@") +1);

console.log(userName);
console.log(extension);

Explanation: by using .slice we can cut the sting to our desire amount of length here using 0, 5 we cut the string from the index of 0-5
